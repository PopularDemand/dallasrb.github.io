title: Dallas Ruby Brigade
---

<p class="description">
  The Dallas Ruby Brigade has been around since early 2006.
  We work to strengthen the programming community through presentations, hacking, teaching, and learning about the Ruby programming language.
  There is always food.
  Sometimes there is beer.
  All are welcome!
</p>

<h2 id="meetings">Meetings</h2>
<p>
  We meet regularly on Tuesdays.
  The first is our primary meeting which often includes a speaker.
  The other Tuesdays are hacknights.
  We work on personal projects, ask for help, and chat about whatever comes to mind.

    Our yearly tradition is back!
    Bring your best and worst code from the year and show everyone.
    We’ll ooh and ah the best and commiserate over the worst.
    We always prefer Ruby code but if you’ve got some bad code in another language we can look at that too.
